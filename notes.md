# Simple vector database
**This is a VERY simple in-memory vector database. You shouldn't even consider using it because it's just a POC and something I made for fun.**

See [examples](./python-examples/) for some code examples. 

## Thanks
[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) has some [great articles](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/) (["vector indexes"](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/vector-indexes/)) and especially some of the videos from [James Briggs](https://www.youtube.com/@jamesbriggs) on the subject (["Faiss - Introduction to Similarity Search"](https://youtu.be/sKyvsdEv6rk)) made things easier to grasp.
